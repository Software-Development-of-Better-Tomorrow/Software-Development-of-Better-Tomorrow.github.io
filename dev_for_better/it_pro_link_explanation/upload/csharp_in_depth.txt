Very good & detailed explanation on every aspect of C# programming from bottom to top, so to speak.
I read this book in the second year into when I started my C# adventure.
I do believe that not only really starting from knowing the basics of every programming language but paying attention to its every detail is the best approach.
This is book that is 100% all about that.
