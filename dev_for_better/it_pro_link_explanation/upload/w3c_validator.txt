This is explanation for young programmers/developers :-)
Web developers with 5+ years of experience who do not use beforementioned validator are not web developers.
This website lets you test that the code you write - whether it's HTML or CSS - is valid according to (conforms to) current W3C standard.
In plain English (using simple words), it basically means, that writing 0-errors HTML/CSS code (without errors) you have greater chance that your website will appear in the first 10 results in Google with some degree of simplification.
Second thing you get from such clean & correct code is the professionalism that is being associated with you.
