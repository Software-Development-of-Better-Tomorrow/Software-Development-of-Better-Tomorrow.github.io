Why ?
As LinkedIn is primarily intended for people who are professionals, then SlideShare is for these people to share their professional presentations, infographics, documents.
Not to be offensive in any way, IMHO it's like Instagram is for sharing pictures then SlideShare is for sharing beforementioned stuff.
Or, you can just search for some particular content as well :-), f.e. typing Microsoft in the search box - yes, of course - you can easily find out (get to know) that LinkedIn is acquired by Microsoft (ninth presentation counting from left to right).
