This is a platform of various tutorials (not only IT-related ones), development tools and programming environments.
You can also watch video tutorials for free and teach people.
The best for me is Coding Ground, where you can practise, test or check some functionalities in 80 programming languages :-)
Of very good usage are also [ Net Meeting ], [ SENDFiles ] and [ Whiteboard ] that can be accessed at the top of the page.
All available tools can be found under [ Tools ] option in the same place.
