This whole section treats about security when it comes to data on any website, even if it is an open source website.
You will find there core explanation on how to write more secure websites with more flexible approaches to writing code.
What I mean by flexible approaches is this simple fact that URL addresses can be written in a way to allow them "adjust" themselves to the protocol under which they are being execute.
And many more.
I do recommend reading this whole section.
