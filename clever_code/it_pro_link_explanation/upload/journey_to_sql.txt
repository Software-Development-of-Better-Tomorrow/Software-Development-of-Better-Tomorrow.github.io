When I started visiting this website around 7 years ago, I was able to quickly get answer for sometimes trivial questions, like f.e. how to calculate first day of month etc.
That kind of thing.
I remember that I was really very impressed by this authority's short, clear and easy to understand answers to some common T-SQL problems.
Now I visit this page now and then, to be honest :-).
Last time I read an article on T-SQL compression in early February 2017.
